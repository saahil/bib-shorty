Motivation
----------
I'm always trying to squeeze in as much text within my conference submissions' page limits as I can. 

Solution
--------
1. Shorten all bibliography items (BibTex) to only the mandatory fields and nothing else. 
2. Shorten all author first names to initials only. 

Caveats
-------
Probably works on a very limited number of BibTex formats. Write to me at saahil.in@gmail.com if you find issues.
